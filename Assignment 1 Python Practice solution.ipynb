    "Many text mining problems use word encodings as an input to the analytic process. The idea behind word encodings is very simple: a corpus of documents (corpus = \"many documents\" in simple English!) contains a vocabulary (the set of words used across all documents). The vocabulary is textual (\"green\", \"people\", \"carrots\") but data analysis works better with numeric data. The solution is to replace each word with a numeric code. For example, if the corpus contains two documents:\n",

    "doc2 = \"The good times of today are the sad thoughts of tomorrow\"\n",
